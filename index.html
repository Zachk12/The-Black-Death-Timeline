    <hr>
    <h3 class="timeline-header__subtitle">This timeline is a chronology of the Black Death, also known as the Black Plague, in the early to mid-14th century. The bacteria <i>Yersinia petis</i> is believed to have been the cause of the Black Death. The bacteria was transferred to humans through the bite of infected rat fleas. Once the flea’s host was infected, the bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiplied. <i>Yersinia petis</i> is harmless to the flea, allowing it to seek new prey when its hosts die. The Black Death was one of the greatest pandemics in human history, estimated to having killed as many as 200 million people with around 50 million being from Europe. The 50 million deaths were estimated to be around 60 percent of Europe's entire population.<br>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1330s</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">While all scholars agree that the Black Death originated in Central Asia, it is widely disputed where in Central Asia. Scholars do know that in 1331 an outbreak erupted in the Yuan Empire and three years later in the Hebei Province, the disease killed over 90 percent of the population with deaths totaling over 5 million. Although it is estimated that the plague killed 25 million Chinese and other Asians before spreading.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1346</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">In 1346, the plague managed to spread to the Mongol warriors who were besieging the city of Caffa located on the Crimean Peninsula. The plague devastated the Mongol army, forcing them to give up the siege. Stories from the period tell that the Mongols catapulted the bodies of plague victims into the city infecting the residents of Caffa and Italian traders who fled the city carrying the plague with them to other countries.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Spring 1347</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">Ships from Caffa that carried the Black Death on board arrived in the city of Constantinople. Due to Constantinople being one of the largest trading hubs in the world at the time, the plague was easily able to spread to the Middle East and European countries who frequented Constantinople’s ports.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">September 1347</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Black Death reaches Alexandria, a city in Egypt, which was another major trading hub similar to Constantinople. It is believed that Alexandria was infected through trade with Constantinople, and other ports located on the Black Sea. During this same year, the infection of Alexandria caused the plague to spread like wildfire throughout the Middle East. Every country effected suffered a massive pandemic with an estimated one third of the population in the Middle East dying from the plague.</p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Plague reached Messina, Sicily in 1347 carried by ships from Caffa and Constantinople. The people of Messina quickly realized the horrible sickness enveloping the port and attempted to expel themselves from the area. Although it was too late, the plague quickly spread throughout the city and the nearby countryside.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">January 1348</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">After sweeping through Sicily, the Black Death made its way into Venice and Genoa. Just a few weeks later, the plague was found in Florence's seaport city of Pisa and from here it rapidly moved inland all throughout Italy. When the plague started to die down, it had already killed more than a third of Italy’s population.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">January 1348</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">In Mediterranean Europe, Marseille (a city in France) acted as the main source for the plague to spread throughout Europe as ships would be constantly traveling to and from the already highly infected Constantinople. The plague rapidly advanced both to the north and to the southwest towards Spain. In Toulon, France around 40 Jews were massacred due to people believing that the Jews had caused the plague by poisoning the wells.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">Summer 1348</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The first known case of the plague in England was in June when a sailor arrived at Weymouth (a town in south England); however, it is also argued that the plague arrived first in Bristol. From Weymouth, the disease engulfed England at a rapid pace moving across the south-west to Bristol. By August, the plague reached London. Being the largest city in England, London had extremely poor sanitation due to being overcrowded, not to mention the Thames River was a polluted mess. These conditions were perfect for the disease to flourish. The King attempted to alleviate the sanitation problem by telling the town council to clean the streets. Sadly, the council replied saying they could do nothing because all of its street cleaners have died of the plague.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1350</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">By 1350, the Black Death was in full effect all throughout Europe. In London, the plague had got so severe it was reported that 200 people were dying every day. In total, about 30-40% of England’s entire population were killed by the plague which was estimated to be around 2 million people. Because of the incredible amount of deaths, many who died were thrown into open public graves or “pits.” The Scots attempted to invade north England during the height of the plague, but they managed to infect themselves bringing the plague back with them to Scotland.</p>

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1354</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Black Death had almost died out at this point. It would take around 200 years for the world population to recover to its pre-plague level. Overall, the plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of human history.</p>
